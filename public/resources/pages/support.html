                        While the software is free of charge, there are costs involved in taking Microsoft Education Delivery into use.
                        The cost of implementation varies greatly depending on factors, such as country,
                        content used (using free content vs. creating new content), server choice
                        (using our hosted, ready-to-use cloud server vs. setting up own server),
                        need for mobile phones and network costs.

                        What devices is Microsoft Education Delivery compatible with?
                    </div>
                    The software runs on Windows 8.1 devices. We recommend Lumia 630, 635 and 930 as these devices have a screen projection capability.
                    Note however, that not all the devices that are compatible
                    with Microsoft Education Delivery have the TV-out feature. For class room usage,
                    Microsoft Education Delivery requires a device with “TV-out”, or video output receptacle,
                    meaning that the phone can be attached to a TV or projector to allow for the display of the content on a screen.

                        Is Internet connection needed to use Microsoft Education Delivery?
                    </div>
                    The videos reside on a cloud server, so an internet connection is necessary,
                    either through a data connection via cellular network (data package) or a Wi-Fi connection.
                    However, once the videos have been downloaded, there is no further need for internet connection.

                    As an implementer of Microsoft Education Delivery you have two options:
                    you can either use our ready-to-use cloud server which provides site management via a web browser,
                    OR you can set up the content management service yourself on your own server,
                    provided that you have your own static ip address. The choice is yours.
